# Testing Docs

- Tests are written using react-testing-library and jest.

- Premade basic components for testing use are in the __tests__/testComponents dir, imported and exported form the index.js file there.

- Test components: 
  - TestButton.js
  - TestForm.js

- So you can import them from testComponents.
